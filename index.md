We'll be posting more of our introductory tutorial sequence here shortly, but the first step is installing ROOT on your personal laptop.

We also have a Caltech twiki page for the summer [here](https://twiki.hep.caltech.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/Summer2016), where we've posted instructions for getting a CERN computing account if you need one, as well as useful information for spending the summer at CERN. You can also take a look at completed summer student projects from previous years.

## Tutorial list

  - [Getting Started](day0) -- Install ROOT, git
  - [Basic ROOT Use](day1) -- make a histogram
