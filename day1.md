Nothing on github for today, you'll be setting up ROOT on your personal computer.

## Installing ROOT version 6.06

[ROOT prerequisites by operating system](https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites)

## For Windows users

The current version of ROOT is not supported on Windows, and Unix/Linux is the default in HEP, so we strongly encourage you to get an Unix/Linux installation. Ubuntu is a user-friendly place to start if you've never seen Linux before, and there are ways to install it and keep your Windows install (dual boot or virtual machine). We’ve compiled some links for your convenience but follow them at your own risk!

- [Get Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/)
- [Instructions for dual booting Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot)
- [Setup a virtual machine with Ubuntu](http://www.instructables.com/id/Introduction-38/)

You're now running Ubuntu, so skip to the Ubuntu instructions.

## For Ubuntu/UNIX users

These two links should have everything you need to install ROOT:

- [Get the source code](https://root.cern.ch/content/release-60602)
- [Compile and install on UNIX machines with cmake](https://root.cern.ch/installing-root-source)

## For OS X users

Follow this [excellent guide](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/root-on-os-x-el-capitan/) for OS X 10.11 (and 10.8/10.9).
