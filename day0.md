Nothing on github for today, you'll be setting up ROOT on your personal computer.

## Installing ROOT version 6.06

[ROOT prerequisites by operating system](https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites)

## For Windows users

The current version of ROOT is not supported on Windows, and Unix/Linux is the default in HEP, so we strongly encourage you to get an Unix/Linux installation. Ubuntu is a user-friendly place to start if you've never seen Linux before, and there are ways to install it and keep your Windows install (dual boot or virtual machine). Weâ€™ve compiled some links for your convenience but follow them at your own risk!

- [Get Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/)
- [Instructions for dual booting Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot)
- [Setup a virtual machine with Ubuntu](http://www.instructables.com/id/Introduction-38/)

You're now running Ubuntu, so skip to the Ubuntu instructions.

## For Ubuntu/UNIX users

These two links should have everything you need to install ROOT:

- [Get the source code](https://root.cern.ch/content/release-60602)
- [Compile and install on UNIX machines with cmake](https://root.cern.ch/installing-root-source)

## For OS X users

Follow this [excellent guide](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/root-on-os-x-el-capitan/) for OS X 10.11 (and 10.8/10.9).
