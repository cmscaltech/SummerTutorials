Today we'll be setting up ROOT and git on your personal computer.

# Installing ROOT version 6.06

[ROOT prerequisites by operating system](https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites)

## For Windows users

The current version of ROOT is not supported on Windows, and Unix/Linux is the default in HEP, so we strongly encourage you to get an Unix/Linux installation. Ubuntu is a user-friendly place to start if you've never seen Linux before, and there are ways to install it and keep your Windows install (dual boot or virtual machine). Weâ€™ve compiled some links for your convenience but follow them at your own risk!

- [Get Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/)
- [Instructions for dual booting Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot)
- [Setup a virtual machine with Ubuntu](http://www.instructables.com/id/Introduction-38/)

You're now running Ubuntu, so skip to the Ubuntu instructions.

## For Ubuntu/UNIX users

These two links should have everything you need to install ROOT:

- [Get the source code](https://root.cern.ch/content/release-60602)
- [Compile and install on UNIX machines with cmake](https://root.cern.ch/installing-root-source)

## For OS X users

Follow this [excellent guide](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/root-on-os-x-el-capitan/) for OS X 10.11 (and 10.8/10.9).

# Github

Our tutorials (and this site) live in our [github](https://github.com/cmscaltech/SummerTutorials). You can download everything [here](https://github.com/cmscaltech/SummerTutorials/archive/master.zip), but we suggest you setup your own github accounts both for this tutorial and version control throughout the summer.

If you want to try git, [this](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) is a good place to start.

All of the git documentation is very useful, but the sections on [installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [first time setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) are enough to get you started.

Once you have git, open the command line and run

     git clone https://github.com/cmscaltech/SummerTutorials.git

on your machine with ROOT installed to get our repository.

# UNIX

If you've never worked in a UNIX environment, here's an overview of the essentials: [Thirty useful Unix commands](http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/docs/leaflets/u5)
