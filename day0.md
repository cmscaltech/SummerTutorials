Nothing on github for today, you'll be setting up ROOT and git on your personal computer.

# Installing ROOT version 6.06

[ROOT prerequisites by operating system](https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites)

## For Windows users

The current version of ROOT is not supported on Windows, and Unix/Linux is the default in HEP, so we strongly encourage you to get an Unix/Linux installation. Ubuntu is a user-friendly place to start if you've never seen Linux before, and there are ways to install it and keep your Windows install (dual boot or virtual machine). We’ve compiled some links for your convenience but follow them at your own risk!

- [Get Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/)
- [Instructions for dual booting Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot)
- [Setup a virtual machine with Ubuntu](http://www.instructables.com/id/Introduction-38/)

You're now running Ubuntu, so skip to the Ubuntu instructions.

## For Ubuntu/UNIX users

These two links should have everything you need to install ROOT:

- [Get the source code](https://root.cern.ch/content/release-60602)
- [Compile and install on UNIX machines with cmake](https://root.cern.ch/installing-root-source)

## For OS X users

Follow this [excellent guide](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/root-on-os-x-el-capitan/) for OS X 10.11 (and 10.8/10.9).

# Github

Our tutorials (and this site) live in our [github](https://github.com/cmscaltech/SummerTutorials). You can download everything [here](https://github.com/cmscaltech/SummerTutorials/archive/master.zip), but we suggest you setup your own github accounts both for this tutorial and version control throughout the summer.

If you want to try git, [this](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) is a good place to start.

All of the git documentation is very useful, but the sections on [installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [first time setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) are enough to get you started.

Once you have git, open the command line and run

     git clone https://github.com/cmscaltech/SummerTutorials.git

on your machine with ROOT installed to get our repository.

# UNIX

If you've never worked in a UNIX environment, here's an overview of the essentials: [Thirty useful Unix commands](http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/docs/leaflets/u5)
